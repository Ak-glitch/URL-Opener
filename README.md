# URL-Opener
Using this tool you will be open to open all the URLs from a file.

PREREQUISITES:
1. Python 3.5+ installed on your computer.
2. Know how to use and execute scripts.
3. I would suggest to use Sublime text code editor to execute the file. But it can also be executed from the terminal itself.
4. Don't forget to save the file that contains URLs of the sub-domains.
5. Specify the exact path of the file containing URLs.
