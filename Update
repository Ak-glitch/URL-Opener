UPDATE:


While using tools like virustotal.com(to get the sub-domains), it's going to be difficult to open the links for they also have
IP addresses attached to it.
So, in the next script, this problem will also be sorted out.


DO SUGGEST ME SOME IMPROVEMENTS OR ANY IDEAS YOU HAVE GOT TO IMPROVE THIS TOOL AND I WOULD TRY MY BEST TO BRING THEM TO LIFE.

ENJOY
